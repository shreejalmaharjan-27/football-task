# Backend code

### Configuring the backend

- Change the `port` in the developement.json file in the config folder to the port you want to run the backend on.
- Change the `mongoURI` in the developement.json file in the config folder to the URI of your MongoDB database.

## Running the backend

```
npm run dev
```

## Note:

The backend automatically imports the samples from the csv file to the mongoDB.
